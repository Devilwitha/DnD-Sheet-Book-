feat: Add interactive features to character sheet

This commit introduces several new features to the character sheet to make it more interactive and align with D&D rules:

- **Resting:** A "Rast" button has been added with "Grosse Rast" (Long Rest) and "Kleine Rast" (Short Rest) options. Long rests restore all HP and spell slots, while short rests allow spending hit dice to heal.
- **Spell Casting:** Spell descriptions now include a "Wirken" (Cast) button. The spell list displays current vs. maximum spell slots (e.g., 3/4), and casting a spell consumes a slot.
- **Dice Rolling:** Buttons for rolling Initiative and a general d20 have been added for quick access.
- **Healing Items:** The inventory system has been updated to support healing items. When creating an item, it can be marked as a healing item with specific dice for healing. Using the item from the inventory automatically calculates and applies the healing to the character's HP.

feat: Add WLAN data transfer with automatic discovery

This commit introduces a new feature that allows users to transfer character save files (.char) over a local network.

The feature is accessible via a "SaveData Ã¼bertragen" button on the options screen. The new transfer screen allows users to send or receive files.

- Senders can select which .char files to send from a list with checkboxes.
- Receivers can automatically discover available senders on the network without needing to enter an IP address. This is implemented using the Zeroconf library.
- The file transfer is handled using sockets in separate threads to keep the UI responsive.

fix: Resolve multiple UI and networking bugs

This commit also includes several critical fixes to the implementation based on user feedback and testing:

- **Checkbox Rendering:** Fixed a persistent bug where checkboxes were not visible by providing a fixed width in the Kivy layout, ensuring they are rendered correctly.
- **UI Threading:** Fixed a `TypeError` crash by ensuring all UI updates from the network discovery thread are safely scheduled on the main Kivy thread using `Clock.schedule_once`.
- **Network Stability:** Fixed a `NonUniqueNameException` crash by allowing Zeroconf to automatically handle service name conflicts.
- **Connection Port:** Fixed a bug where the client used a hardcoded port instead of the one discovered by Zeroconf.
- **UI Layout:** Corrected several layout issues in `transferscreen.kv`, including removing duplicated rules and ensuring buttons are placed in the correct views.
- **Windows Compatibility:** Improved IP address detection to be more robust on Windows and other platforms.

- **New Changelog Screen:**
  - A `changelog.txt` file has been added to the repository.
  - A new "Changelog" button on the `SystemScreen` leads to a new, dedicated `ChangelogScreen`.
