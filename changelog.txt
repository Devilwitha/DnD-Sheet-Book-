feat: Add System/Changelog screens and refactor Options menu

This commit introduces a significant refactoring of the options menu into multiple sub-screens and adds a new changelog feature.

- **Options Screen Refactoring:**
  - The `OptionsScreen` has been further refactored. It now navigates to two new sub-menus: "Gui Einstellungen" (`SettingsScreen`) and "System Einstellungen" (`SystemScreen`).
  - The `SystemScreen` now contains the buttons for restarting the app, shutting down the system, and checking for updates.

- **New Changelog Screen:**
  - A `changelog.txt` file has been added to the repository.
  - A new "Changelog" button on the `SystemScreen` leads to a new, dedicated `ChangelogScreen`.
  - This screen displays the contents of `changelog.txt` in a scrollable view.
