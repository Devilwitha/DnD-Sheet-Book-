feat: Add DM Spiel mode

This commit introduces a new "DM Spiel" mode, which allows for a networked D&D session between a Dungeon Master and players.

- **New Screens:**
  - "DM Spiel" screen with options to "DM Hosten", "Spieler beitreten", or "DM Vorbereiten".
  - DM lobby screen to manage connected players.
  - Player lobby screen to connect to a DM.
  - DM main screen with an overview of players, enemies, and an event log.
  - Player main screen to view character sheet and game events.
  - DM preparation screen to manage enemy lists and session notes.

- **Networking:**
  - Implemented a client-server architecture using sockets.
  - The DM acts as the server, players as clients.
  - Automatic discovery of the DM on the local network using Zeroconf.
  - Character data is transferred from players to the DM.

- **Game Features:**
  - DM can manage connected players (kick).
  - DM can add offline players.
  - DM can load and manage enemy lists.

feat: Add WLAN data transfer with automatic discovery

This commit introduces a new feature that allows users to transfer character save files (.char) over a local network.

The feature is accessible via a "SaveData Ã¼bertragen" button on the options screen. The new transfer screen allows users to send or receive files.

- Senders can select which .char files to send from a list with checkboxes.
- Receivers can automatically discover available senders on the network without needing to enter an IP address. This is implemented using the Zeroconf library.
- The file transfer is handled using sockets in separate threads to keep the UI responsive.

fix: Resolve multiple UI and networking bugs

This commit also includes several critical fixes to the implementation based on user feedback and testing:

- **Checkbox Rendering:** Fixed a persistent bug where checkboxes were not visible by providing a fixed width in the Kivy layout, ensuring they are rendered correctly.
- **UI Threading:** Fixed a `TypeError` crash by ensuring all UI updates from the network discovery thread are safely scheduled on the main Kivy thread using `Clock.schedule_once`.
- **Network Stability:** Fixed a `NonUniqueNameException` crash by allowing Zeroconf to automatically handle service name conflicts.
- **Connection Port:** Fixed a bug where the client used a hardcoded port instead of the one discovered by Zeroconf.
- **UI Layout:** Corrected several layout issues in `transferscreen.kv`, including removing duplicated rules and ensuring buttons are placed in the correct views.
- **Windows Compatibility:** Improved IP address detection to be more robust on Windows and other platforms.

feat: Add System/Changelog screens and refactor Options menu

This commit introduces a significant refactoring of the options menu into multiple sub-screens and adds a new changelog feature.

- **Options Screen Refactoring:**
  - The `OptionsScreen` has been further refactored. It now navigates to two new sub-menus: "Gui Einstellungen" (`SettingsScreen`) and "System Einstellungen" (`SystemScreen`).
  - The `SystemScreen` now contains the buttons for restarting the app, shutting down the system, and checking for updates.

- **New Changelog Screen:**
  - A `changelog.txt` file has been added to the repository.
  - A new "Changelog" button on the `SystemScreen` leads to a new, dedicated `ChangelogScreen`.
  - This screen displays the contents of `changelog.txt` in a scrollable view.
